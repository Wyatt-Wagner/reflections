When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When you are collaborating with other people, so they can see your commits when you push them to github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you can decide when the right time to pull changes is in case you made a mistake or want to edit something.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks allow you to clone one repository on github to your page on github. 
Cloning is just copying the repository from github to your local computer. 
Branching is just creating a different branch from the master branch.
  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
So you can know the difference between your master branch and the one on github without merging the two branches.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
I don't think that you can collaborate witnout Git or Github because it is the only place where each individual can push their commits into a common repository.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
